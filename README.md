## User Experience (UX)  
  
### **User Stories**  

### **Primary Goal**  
  
The Cobalt Building is a luxury residential block with 59 apartments in Bridgewater Square, London.   The aim of this website is to showcase the building and the history of the area.  It needed a strong, succinct and striking website design that reflected the building’s attributes and the area’s importance in the development of the City of London. 

### **Visitor Goals** 

- The website is intended to be accessed by two diverse sets of visitors:

1.  Building residents:-
  *	Apartment owners – to access the Leaseholder Portal containing the building policies and service charge accounts of the individual apartment owner
  *	Tenants – over 80% of the apartments are tenanted by City professionals and students with an average tenant turn-around of two years.  So it was important to clearly set out the attractiveness of the Cobalt Building in terms of location and amenities and the history of the area. 
   
2. History lovers - Bridgewater Square is often overshadowed by its neighbour, the iconic Barbican Estate.  This website attempts to redress that and invites users to visit Bridgewater Square.   This additional set of visitors was identified when the user performas were generated. 

- Keeping the above, the website is straight to the point and easy to navigate for those seeking information about the building, its location and the history of the area. 

- The website has been designed to be responsive to allow visitors to view it from a range of devices with one page flowing seamlessly into another so as to keep the users engaged on each page.   

### **First Time Visitor**
- A user can access each page of the site with one click via the navigation bar or by scrolling down the respective sections on the landing page.
- A user can see the address of the building in the footer.

### **Returning Visitor**  
- The returning visitor is one who is seriously interested in the building e.g. as a potential tenant or history lover.  
- Such a user is likely to use a device larger than a mobile.  They will be able to find more relevant information in the footer e.g. social media links, contact form for the Resident Management Company and the contact card for the Property Manager; an apartment owner will  see the Leaseholder Portal button on the navigation bar; a history student can find links for the sources of information collated on this website for further study.

## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  

- The strtaegy was to build an easy-to-click & follow, simple, non-intimidatory website that delivers clear information about diabetes and measures that the user should take to prevent it.  
- As the user is required to interact with the tool, the entire website needed to be inviting, with the use of consistent and neat design, graphics, precise wording and colour.  
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.
  
### **2. Scope**  

- The Diabeater website must be available on a wide range of devices due to the age range of the users being targetted. 
- The site is to contain only essential information presented artistically using the best utility function for each page.  
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user access to all the information.  
- Future development is to include the ability for a user to set up their account on The Diabeater.  Users will then have access to create their weekly diet plans within the parameters suggested by The Diabeater (this requires API integration of the Recipe database from Edamam) and view live prices for a shopping trolley made up of the main ingredients of the recipes in their chosen diet plan (this requires API integration to a major UK supermarket).   
  
### **3. Structure**  

- The website is currrently set up as a single landing page with scroll down simple navigation.  
- The interactive form is halfway down the landing page and designed with Javascript to provide swift feedback to users.  The button on the form is easy to identify, its purpose clearly stated and large size so as to assist users of all ages and improve partipation rates.  sy to identify, clickable buttons and links with a consistent layout have been used in the navigation bar and footer.  
  
### **4. Skeleton**  

- The site was developed to be simple, clear and educational.  
- It is kept to one landing page style only.  
- The navbar contains a centred logo with a tag line underneath it.
- The next section highlights information about diabetes set out in 3 card styles with image top and text bottom - pattern reversed for the middle card.  
- This leads to the form to be completed by the user and empty space which gives feedback.
- The next section sets out examples of diabetes-beating diets and other helpful tips.  
- The landing page ends with the footer, which shows the logo and copyright label on the left and the social media links on the righ.
   

### Wireframes  
<details open>
<summary>Wireframe for the 4 pages of the webite - Desktop view</summary>  

![Wireframe of the 4 pages- Desktop](docs/Wireframes.jpg)
            

### **5. Surface**  

- A design was created that allowed a simple consistent fluid information flow down the landing page.     
- A palette of colours evoking a healthy diet was chosen as the main method to beat diabetes is through changing one's diet. 
- The Quicksand font is a display sans serif with rounded terminals in regular weight was used which is easy to read gives a soft inviting feel to a subject most people want ignore/put on the bottom shelf.   
  
## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

- I did a Google search to identify the current vogue 'diet' colors and then used [Adobe Color](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/color.html) to generate the palette used in The Diabeater.  

![Colour theme swatches](.docs/AdobeColor-My Color Theme (2).jpg) 

- An integrated play of 4 main colours of the colour palette was done throughout the landing page and one colour reserved as the background colour for the logo.  These pastel colours are soothing and encouraging and totally captivate the user to make transformational changes - even those who've only had a fleeting thought on how to fight the diabetes disease.  

  
### **Typography**  
  
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the font 'Quicksand'.  The Quicksand font is a display sans-serif font so it is eye-catching and draws the user through the page/form and feedback. The regular font weight is used.
  
![Google Fonts Quicksand](docs/fonts.google.com_specimen_Quicksand.png)

        
### **Imagery**  
  
- I have used different types of imagery so as to remain authentic about the website.  I have used:
  *	Historic photos from books and archives
  * Historic maps - some of which have been made dynamic with modern technology which helped me get a snapshot of the precise area covered in the website
  * Modern photos from the marketing brochure for the Cobalt building which was published in 1995
  * Publicly available photos of apartment interiors from estate agent websites marketing apartments available for sale and rent at the Cobalt Building
  *	Royalty free stock images
  * Bootstrap icons
- I have attributed the sources of the images used in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

<details open>  
<summary></summary>

#### **Desktop View** 
![screenshot of Desktop headlines image](docs/Desktop%20-%20Headline.png) 
The headlines pull out the key features of the Cobalt Building in all devices.  It is shown as a single band on large screens which becomes a 2 by 2 on smaller screens.  

<br> 


### **Footer**  
<details open>
<summary></summary>

#### **Desktop View** 
![screenshot of footer](docs/Desktop%20-%20Footer.png) 
</details>
The footer always shows the address of the Cobalt Building in all screen views.  It expands to show the Contact form and card for the Resident Management Company and the Property Manager respectively, social media icons and Acknowledgements.  

<br>

#### **Mobile View** 
![screenshot of Mobile Home Page](docs/Mobile%20-%20Landing%20Page.png)  
 
</details>
Small sound-bytes of text with clear headings are accompanied by striking images that reflect the heading. There are links to each of the 3 other pages under the images.  the In mobile view, these sections are displayed in a column and the images and liks to the other 3 pages are not displayed.   

<br>
  
### **Cobalt Building Page** 
<details>
<summary></summary> 

#### **Desktop View**
![screenshot of Desktop Cobalt Building Page](docs/Desktop%20-%20Cobalt%20Building%20page.png)  

#### **Mobile View**

</details>
The masonry layout occupies the whole page, against the yellow (#FFBF69) background (which is the exterior colour of the Cobalt Building).  Images and stylised text draw out the main attributes of the building and apartments.  The masonry layout automatically rearranges the cards to optimise the viewing experience from different size device screens.  It switches from a 3 column large screen view to a single column for mobile view.  The masonry card display automatically re-arranges on each click of the page.

<br>

### **Location Page**  
<details>
<summary></summary> 

#### **Tablet View** 
![screenshot of Location page](docs/Tablet%20View%20-%20Location%20Page.png)  

</details>
- There are two sections. 
- The first part consists of places in the neighbourhood of the Cobalt Building grouped together in 4 categories.  The 4 categories are then set in a 2 row by 2 in each row format.  Each category is shown by an icon and text describing each of 4 categories.  The icon is positioned to the left of the text for desktop/tablet views and switches to center in single columnar format for mobile view.   

- The second section shows an embedded interactive Google Map sitting in a row.  The smallest width of this page is limited by the size of the Google Map.  

<br>

![screenshot of Desktop History Page](docs/Desktop%20-%20History%20Page.png)  

#### **Mobile View** 
![screenshot of Mobile History Page](docs/Mobile%20-%20History%20Page.png) 
</details>
- A stylised vertical time line is shown here with image and text on either side of a central dot arranged diametrically.  This is for larger screens.  This changes to a single columnar format of text and image for mobile views.  
- The timeline is split into 6 sections from 1 AD.   

<br>

## Desktop & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  
  
- As most of the website code was imported from Bootstrap there was already good in-built responsivity across various screens. I had to make minimal adjustments to improve this.  
- However, I had to compromise by making some of the elements in the navigation bar, footer and hero image disappear for mobile views as I was not successful in styling these for responsivity.  
- See image below of the website as displayed on desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile screens from [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)     
  
![screenshots of website on Am I Responsive](docs/ui.dev_amiresponsive_.png)

## Future Features  

- For future development, I would like to be able to:
 * show all of the footer and the button to the Leaseholder Portal in the navigation bar on all screen sizes    
 * put an embedded video showing a tour around the present Bridgewater Square
 * show testimonials from site visitors

### **Bugs & Fixes**  
  
  - There were a number of bugs which I fixed during the build phase and the two main ones are as below.

| Bug | Section | Fix |
| :----| :----| :--------:|
| Nesting button element in an anchor element | Navigation Bar | When running the W3C validation test, I discovered that I had made an error by placing a button element inside an anchor element for the Leaseholder Portal button. Semantically, this was incorrect. I was trying to put a hyperlink in a button.  The options to solve this were presented in this [article](https://testbook.com/web-development/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20the%20OnClick,to%20define%20the%20link%20address.) and I changed the code as per Option 1.  I re-checked my HTML code with W3C Validator and my site to find the issue resolved. |
| br element in li element  | Footer |  Semantically I made an error by using the br element to make space between the social icons in the footer. On performing the W3C validation test, I became aware of this error. I experimented by (1) putting separate divs for each social media icon and (2) putting each social media item in a separate ul and li combination.  Option (2) worked and the W3C Validator passed my HTML code.|

### **Unsolved Bugs** 

- Some of the Location page masonry images lie on top of the footer when this page is opened first.  I have not managed to understand why this happens so I will keep researching to solve this issue.
- I was not able to make the the Leaseholder Portal button in the navigation bar fully responsive so I had to remove it for smaller screen views.  I will try to find out the reason for this and then find a solution.
- The footer responsiveness also needs to be improved so that all the 4 columns fit for all screen views.  I will continue to look for a solution for this.

### **Acknowledgements** 

- I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our Bootcamp instructor Richey Malhotra for his patience and guidance and most of all for setting me up with the stylised hero image for the home page of this website.
- I am grateful for the support and help given by my Bootcamp cohort colleagues Rob, Rosie and Sharon for debugging and design.   
- I am thankful to WAES and the Code Institute for providing this unique opportunity for me to upskill and learn Digital Skills.
- Last but not least, I am grateful to my sister for looking after our parents so that I have been able to devote time to learning the technology and creating this website.

### **Reflections** 

- This is my first website project from scratch.  
- Initially, I found it a giant task as a) none of my code would work and b) I was researching the subject matter as I wanted to create a meaningful and value-adding publically available website.  However, following the principles as taught on this Bootcamp to date (Jan 2023) and once the home page began to take shape, my confidence in coding and using Bootstrap grew.  I was then able to work through the rest of the website more comfortably.  However, I did decide, to build a demo site first and then copied that across to this site (therefore my commits are fewer here).  
- I have learnt how important patience and systematic thinking are for software development and that such an approach does indeed deliver results.  
- I am also tremendously pleased and excited that the website fully reflects the vision I had of it at the beginning of this project!
